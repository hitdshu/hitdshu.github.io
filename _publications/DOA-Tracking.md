In this paper, we propose a novel DOA tracking algorithm based on Least Square Compressive Sensing. The algorithm comes from the observation that a compressive sensing problem turns into a least square problem once the support is known. Utilizing the support from former time instant, compressive sensing recovery is performed on residual when least square residual is bigger than a threshold. In order to improve the resolution and decrease computation complexity, grid refinement is performed before least square. Under the assumption that the sparsity pattern of signal changes slowly, the grid refinement step is sufficient to track the DOA and the compressive sensing recovery step can be omitted in most of the time. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DOA tracking algorithm possess better performance and requires less computational complexity.
