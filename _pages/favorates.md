# Books

[State Estimation for Robotics](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/bib/barfoot_ser17.pdf) by barfoot. This book illustrates the relationship between filtering and optimization in a very elegant way.

[Principles of Digital Communication](https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/Principles_of_Digital_Communication.html?id=5W0aYFU02igC&redir_esc=y) by robert gallager. The book dives into mathmatics of communication deeply. And you'll find that gallager presents the theory in a layered way, which inspires me the importance of hierarchical thinking.

[Digital Communication](http://barry.ece.gatech.edu/digital/) by john barry. This is arguablely my favorate book despite several over simplistic sections. The book is very hard and has tens of thousands of formulas. But it behaves exactly like a communication theorist.

[Computer Vision:  Models, Learning, and Inference](http://www.computervisionmodels.com/). The book has many wonderful pictures and it's suitable for beginners.

[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387310732). An interesting book for bayesian statistics. We may need it for some formulas derivation sometimes.
