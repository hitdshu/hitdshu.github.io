But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. 
--Bible

Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. 
--Einstein

The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. 
--Claude Shannon

Engineering is necessary to choose appropriate theoretical models, and theory is necessary to find the general properties of those models. 
--Robert Gallager

All knowledge is, in final analysis, history. All sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics. All judgements are, in their rationale, statistics. 
--Statistics And Truth

The fundamental equation of computers is: computer = powerful + stupid. Computers are very powerful, looking at volumes of data very quickly. Computers can perform billions of operations per second, where each operation is pretty simple. Computers are also shockingly stupid and fragile. The operations that they can do are extremely rigid, simple, and mechanical. The computer lacks anything like real insight ... it's nothing like the HAL 9000 from the movies. If nothing else, you should not be intimidated by the computer as if it's some sort of brain. It's very mechanical underneath it all. Programming is about a person using their real insight to build something useful, constructed out of these teeny, simple little operations that the computer can do.
--Francisco Cai and Nick Parlante
